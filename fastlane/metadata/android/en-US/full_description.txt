Use your phone or tablet to study diseases, predict global warming, or discover pulsars!  BOINC harnesses the unused computing power of your Android device and runs jobs for scientific research projects.  You can choose from projects in several areas of science, including Asteroids@home, Einstein@home, LHC@home, Moo!Wrapper, Rosetta@home, Universe@home, World Community Grid, Yoyo@home.

BOINC computes only when your device is plugged in and charged, so it won't run down your battery.  It transfers data over WiFi, so it won't use up your cell phone plan's data limit.
